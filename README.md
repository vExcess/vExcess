<h3>Hi There, I'm Vincent!</h3>
I'm a self taught full stack web developer who enjoys programming in JavaScript, Dart, and Zig. I use Linux Mint, VS Code, and avoid using frameworks because they make projects bloated. My current passion project is creating a FOSS clone of MS Paint 3D, but I'm waiting until it's more complete to release it. In the meantime check out my other projects:

<h3>List of projects I may or may not ever finish</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://vxsacademy.org/" target="_blank">vxsacademy.org</a> - A website where anyone can learn to code and create + share projects in various langauges for free (currently offline because I broke it).</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/orgs/zwebsuite/repositories" target="_blank">zwebsuite</a> - A suite of web related libraries written in Zig. Includes HTML + CSS parser, and native implementation of HTML Canvas.</li>
    <li>Newwrite - An language model that converts text to a simplified version of English and vice-versa (currently on hold because my understanding of creating LLMs using Tensorflow.js isn't that great)</li>
    <li>TuxTaskManager - Windows styled task manager for Linux (paused development because my Rust code has a memory leak that I can't find. Will eventually rewrite in Zig or Dart.)</li>
</ul>
