<h3>Hi There, I'm Vincent!</h3>
I'm an open-source full-stack web developer who enjoys programming in JavaScript, Dart, and Zig. My choice OS: Linux Mint, IDE: VS Code, WebFramework: Svelte. My current passion project is creating a FOSS clone of MS Paint 3D.

<h3>Here are some projects I may or may not ever finish:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://vxsacademy.org/" target="_blank">vxsacademy.org</a> - A website where anyone can learn to code and create + share projects in various languages for free.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/librepaint/" target="_blank">LibrePaint</a> - A FOSS clone of MS Paint 3D and related graphics libraries.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/vExcess/TuxTaskManager" target="_blank">TuxTaskManager</a> - Windows Task Manager for Linux</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/vExcess/UnShort" target="_blank">UnShort</a> - Chrome extension that hides all shorts on YouTube and also redirects shorts to the regular video player. In addition the extension displays how much time you have spent watching YouTube.</li>
    <li>Newwrite - A language model that converts text to a simplified version of English and vice-versa (currently on hold because my understanding of creating LLMs using Tensorflow.js isn't that great)</li>
</ul>
