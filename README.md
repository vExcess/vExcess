# Hi There, I'm Vincent!
I'm mainly a full stack web developer, but I also enjoy coding in Zig. I have a lot of cool projects. My main one is <a href="https://vxsacademy.org/" target="_blank">https://vxsacademy.org/</a>. I use Linux Mint, VS Code. I avoid using frameworks because they make projects bloated.

## List of projects I may or may not ever finish
<ul>
    <li>vxsacademy - A website where anyone can learn to code and create and share projects in various langauges for free.</li>
    <li>TuxTaskManager - Windows styled task manager for Linux</li>
    <li>codeli - Lightweight code editor</li>
    <li>Newwrite - An language model that converts text to a simplified version of English and vice-versa</li>
    <li>Zig HTML Canvas - HTML's canvas is so great I wanted to make a native version of it</li>
    <li>JITLang - The best programming language ever. It's like if you mixed JavaScript, Rust, Java, C++, Swift, and Zig all into one language.</li>
    <li>wasmdos - An operating system that is fully web assembly compatible so that you can spin up a virtual desktop in your browser</li>
</ul>
